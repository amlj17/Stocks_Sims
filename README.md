# Stocks_Sims
This project dives into monte carlo methods and monte carlo simulation.
It includes a simulation of a stock portfolio as well as an example of how to estimate pi with a circle. 

Note: the project is in spanish as it was turned in as a final project for a stats calss.

The repository contains the following files:
1. Metodos de Monte Carlo Entrega 1: Pdf file; Brief explanation of MC methods and historical background. Pi simulation.
